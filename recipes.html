            <p> My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings. They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it. Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

            <p>This is a tried-and-tested recipe that I have used numerous times for making the perfect chocolate chip banana bread! Not only does it help utilize the bananas that have slowly overripened at the back of the fridge, it ends up creating an incredibly delicious, and relatively healthy, dessert.</p>

            <!-- Paragraph One About Recipe -->
            <p>Swedish pancakes are made from a simple batter consisting of eggs, milk, and salt. They are thin and can be rolled or folded easily. I've used this recipe to make Swedish pancakes with both sweet and savory fillings.</p>

            <!-- Recipe Ingredients -->
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter melted and cooled, plus more for the pan</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Recipe Steps -->
            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.  Transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away.  Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Stir the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter.  Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add ¼ cup of batter. Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan.  Continue swirling until the batter is just set.  Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds. Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper towel as needed. </li>
                <li>Serve with lingonberry jam and butter (see note below) or other desired toppings and/or fillings. See notes below for more information about making ahead of time and storing in the refrigerator or freezer.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Cook: Cook for 2-3 minutes or until golden and crisp, rolling occasionally.</li>
